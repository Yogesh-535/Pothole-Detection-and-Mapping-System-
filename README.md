Pothole-Detection-System-
ROS + Arduino-based Pothole Detection System for EY Techathon 6.0 2025


This project is designed for EY Techathon 6.0 2025.
It detects potholes using LIDAR, Green Laser (Triangulation Method), Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.
The system measures surface depth variations to identify road damages and creates a road map.
